### Layout Options

## Plate

## Middle Column Options
The middle column can be configured with either an OLED or a trackpoint module.  

### Middle Column Cover
Either case, I provide the files for a cover along with plate option to mount the cover.  
Using the cover would help fill/cover up the space between the plate and the top of the case and make the middle column look better than it otherwise would (a.k.a it's just for aesthetics).  
To use the cover, you need M2 screws and standoffs - I find ~6 mm is a good length for the standoffs, though 7 mm also works well and gives enough space for the trackpoint module.
