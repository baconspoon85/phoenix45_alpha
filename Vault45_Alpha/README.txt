This directory contains a Lagacy Vault 45 compatible version of the Phoenix 45 Alpha PCB. The schematic is identical. No annotations or references have changed. All changes are to component positions and edge cuts only, meaning the BOM and firmware for the Phoenix version are compatible. Only separate position files and gerbers generated from this project file are necessary. Additionally, since both boards are mounted via the plate, the custom plate is needed.
